					<h1 class="MainHeader">Jupiter Fishes</h1>
	<p style="text-align: justify">Hello all.<br><br>
	Today I would like to start by telling you what happening with me. Now as you all might've known, there was no article upload last weekend because I wanted to
	conduct additional research into my original idea, which was the Jupiter Jellyfish, in which strictly Jellyfishes lived on, upon further research, its false. 
	School work has been a huge slow down in getting these articles on time, I will open up my time by a substantial ammount by the end of this month to give me 
	the freedoms I need to get out these articles, as I know how many people care about them. <br>
<br>
		I also want to stress the fact that I am not saint, many people have praised me as the second coming of christ, the forthcoming of new knowledge. I am none
		of the sort, I am a person trying to spread the knowledge that I have gained through raw science and immense expertise of this, I have been studing for 7 
		years, and I finally want to share everything, everything that I have ever had collect, finally shared, and I want these articles not to entertain, but to
		prove a point, I want these articles to show the true advancement in human knowledge of the planets, and this is the only way I can do it. Lets get into
		Jupiter Fishes.<br>
<br>
		Now my original piece on Jupiter started out with me explaining Jellyfishes, as that is what I could see through my telescope when looking at Jupiter, 
		Jellyfishes. But I checked again to make sure I got all of the Jellyfish species labeled correctly and accurately. But then, out of nowhere, I split my
		coffee, turned around so hard, my absolute broad ass shoulders nocked the telesope so much that it revealed more of Jupiter, a lost world, something that
		I've never seen before. All the other planets only have one type, you know, only spiders, or only mosquitoes, but this, this was something more, something
		that made my knees buckle at first glance, it was absolutely breath taking.<br>
<br>
		I didn't just see Jellyfishes, but I saw sharks, flounders, tuna, whales, salmon, schools of fish, litterally the entire ocean on Jupiter, all swimming in
		the gas. I caught this observation on the Saturday of release, and spent the rest of the week trying to prove the co-existance of all of these oceanic 
		creatures swimming in the gas of Jupiter. On Wednesday I made a second important discovery, they are nothing like the creatures on Earth, they share the
		some similarties of course but there was something extremely off with these creatures.<br>
<br>
		 Their adaptations they have made to survive in the gas giant, Jupiter, is absolutely out of this world. They don't have gills, they don't have eyes.
		 They all have antennae and have lungs, they breath the hydrogen molecules, they float because of the helium molecules, allowing them survive. 
		 Every single fish from the ocean, mutanted in a grotesque way, so odd that the only way it couldn't make sense if it made sense.<br>
<br>
		They live in schools, each section of the planet is a different inhabitant, they diversity of this planet is astonishing, the whales are giants compared
		to the fish, the dolphins live together in a very unique state, their brains bludge out, making them the smartest creature living in Jupiter. The Narwhals
		are the most peculiar in my honest opinion, they all have this doulbe tusk and their bodies are translucent, they have a very weird physique.<br>
<br>
		One of my most dire questions was what is at the storm. You know, Jupiters red spot. I applied a 10000000x zoom to my telescope and what happened next
		will shock you. The creature at the eye of the strom is none other than Charybdis. I couldn't believe it myself but here I am talking about it, I would
		never lie to you guys, the real Charybdis, creator of whirpools and eater of ass. <br>
<br>
		I'm sorry, this really live, so live that I literally just added this portion just right now, 10 minutes before release of this article, I can't push the 
		article back but I have right about this, it is truely taking everything I know and throwing out the window. Mecca-Hitler fish has risen over and taken 
		over the planet jupiter this is unfucking real. <br>
<br>
		Any ways thank you for reading. Next article on Saturn Dinosaurs up right now.
