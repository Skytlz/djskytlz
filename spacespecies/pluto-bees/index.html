					<h1 class="MainHeader">Pluto Bees</h1>
	<p style="text-align: justify">Hello all.<br><br>
	</p>
		Welcome, to Pluto Bees. Now before I begin I want to give you updates with how things are going. I have found refuge in an abandoned nuclear fallout bunker, with the 
		fastest damn ethernet you have ever seen in your life. I'm going to see how long I can hold out until they find me, theres a secret tunnel passage at the end of the 
		bunker I found, so if I get caught, I have an escape route. My girlfriend left me, I am almost running out of emergency funds. Everything is going so-so. I can only
		hide from Obama, NASA, and the blacks for so long before they can track my every move, which I am still scared about. I had no idea that is was going to get worse when
		I first put out my first article, Moon Spiders, back 3 months ago. From that point I've been running ever since. But because of my limited time I'm going to get to the 
		point. And I'm sorry if these articles seems short, I am running for my life. Thank god we are almost at the end, and my message has been put out of the world.<br>
<br>
		Now I firstly want to immediatly dicuss the debate between losers who claim that Pluto is not a planets vs winners who abide by the fact saying that Pluto is indeed a
		planet. I really do not understand the claim the losers make when they say that Pluto is not a planet, you have so be such an ignorant bellend to believe that Pluto is
		not a planet. Pluto specifically casted into the list of our Solar System, and can be found on pretty much any map of the solar system because Pluto is in the realm of
		our second asteroid belt. Unlike stupid Eris who is dumb. And being that Pluto can sustain life, I mean, literal bees live on pluto, I would say Pluto is a planet.
		People who idiotically rant their head saying that pluto isn't a planet honestly scare me. You think Eris can sustain life? You think Sedna can sustain life? You think
		Orcus can sustain life? You think Kopff can sustain life? You think Makemake can sustain life? You think Haumea can sustain life? You think Quaoar can sustain life?
		You think 2007 OR10 can sustain life? You think 2002 AW197 can sustain life? YOu think 2013 FY27 can sustain life? You think 1995 SN55 can sustain life? You think 
		Chrion could sustain life? Well you are inherently wrong because they don't. Yes, I would consider our moon a planet and our sun. Anything that can sustain life is a 
		planet. So suck it Tom Cruise.<br>
<br>
		Allow me to tell you first about my rational fear of bees. Bee's are probably earths most fuck insect ever to exist. It was a time ago, the bros and I, all you know,
		outside, gaming. Playing a game of Cobs and Roppers. Me, child, was running around the front yard of my friends house, chasing a robber. When I was clearly unaware as
		a child, a stepped in a hole. Now, it wasn't a big large gapping hole in the middle of the ground where my entire foot fell through. No, it was a fair size hole, about
		an inch in diameter. Now I didn't not fell this hole, and kept running, and the entire hive of absolute rampant bees stung my entire body, really. The entire hive came
		up and complete stung me from head to toe. Now at this point, in the front of the yard, I was screaming my head off. Somebody noticed me and tried to open the front
		door to let me in, as I kept frantically shouting "OPEN THE DOOR" as loud as I could, but he was clueless to what was happening. Several kids actually went into the cars on the street and hid in there, pussies. I literally had to run around the entire house and upstairs to their fucking bitch ass second story balcony, to greet all
		of the parents dining (Keep in mind I was at my friends house.... on his birthday). All of the parents ran towards me and punched all of the bees to death and I was in
		shock for 30 minutes, and had 30 bee stings all over my body, including one right under my eye. So that was a good day, and that family never hosted a party since, 
		good on them. Now, everytime I hear any buzzing sound I get tensed up and I freak out, that gave me PTSD. Good thing that bees literally fucked off to the farthest 
		planet they could. <br>
<br>
	  	So bees are most common for their pollination tatics, their raw ability to kill people, and estract flower sperm. Bee's on pluto are still black and yellow and do have
	  	wings, and can actually pollinate using Pluto dust. Because Pluto dust and pollen actually have the same chemical makeup believe it or not, the both have the same
	  	ammount of carbon in them which make it easy for the bee to use and actually that is why Pluto is so small. The bees havea a complex labyrinth of tunnels that run
	  	through the planet's core, pluto is almost of the verge of collapse and can possibly cave in at any moment, though I think it is partly to do with their Nazi regime,
	  	once that is over I think that the planet may actually become stable, but bee's are the most unpredictable creatures.<br>
<br>
		Ok, so between the days of when I first put out my Moon Spiders article, to today when writing this. I have noticed that there are more bees than before. I MEAN WITH A
		PLANET ALREADY RAMPANT WITH BEE'S HOW DOES NATURE FIX THE ISSUE? ADD MORE BEES! They literally have no natural predator except for literally going outside of their
		atmosphere so they can grow exponentially with a higher rate of growth. If the bees so wanted to, they could all get on one side of Pluto and push the planet into
		Neptune and cause a chain reaction that will mean the end of this solar system. Luckily for us superior humans we would already be inhabintants of Mars so it doesn't
		matter. That what I like to think of us humans, the only ones with the balls enough to live through anything. <br>
<br>
		Thank you for reading. Sun Ducks up right now.
