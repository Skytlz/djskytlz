	<p style="text-align: justify">Hello all.<br><br>
	If you are reading this, then I can assume that you have read Pluto, and this post will be along of my trio of Pluto Bees, Sun Ducks, and I am writing this what I think to 
	be 4 days after I wrote Pluto. I have about a weeks ammount of food left, and I am rationing 3 bottles of water. I'll give my self, a week, tops, before the government
	finds me, I think I still have time to write sun ducks, if I can pace myself. I hope I have enough time. I think I will, I'll buy some time, but I will have to be swift
	with my words. I see an easy escape path in case anything does happen, hopefully that won't become a last resort. But I am not here to bother you about me, here is Nibiru.<br>
<br>
	The Nibiru Cataclysm, or simply put, Nibiru is an event that was supposed to take place last decade, this decade, or the next. The event was claimed to be an Unknown
	Planet or "Planet X" was supposed to collide or have a close pass by with Earth. This event was supposed to happen in the early 2000s and it is now supposed to happen next
	year in 2012, but if nothing happens in 2020s. There have beem rumors of what "Planet X" might be, a planet in our own solar system? Or an Unknown Planet in general?
	For starters, okay, lets be real? Okay, lets just be totaly serious here. Okay? I mean, for real. A planet, just crash landing, I mean JUST CRASHING into Earth. I mean.
	YES. IT CAN HAPPEN. Are you so damn blind. I'm not talking about Halley's Comet, not at all. I'm talking about a fully scale planet collision that could happen soon. Now 
	by soon I really mean several years, lets not be total savages here. Ok?<br>
<br>
	I don't have any exacts, but I can say that the Nibiru Cataclysm will be within the years 2015-2025. I'm not bullshiting here, I'm telling you the truth. I'm sorry that I
	can't give you an exact date like ohohoh August 18th, 2020. But I can at least give you a solid timeframe, like a good solid timeframe. 10 years if you think about is
	really not that long, I mean for starters its like being a new born and being 10, or like being 10 and going to 20. It's really not that long a time. But I can say that
	there is an imminent collision with planet Earth and Planet X, that will happen with in 4 years plus then a remaining 10 years. So really everything will fall into place.<br>
<br>
	What is Planet X? What is this mysterious planet that is supposed to absolute fucking collide with Earth? A hidden 10th planet in our solar system. You see many people
	would claim that a 9th planet would just be Pluto, but since we have already said that Pluto is a planet, this "Plant X" would be considered the 10th planet. This planet
	is hidden under regular telescope and whatever technology may be at hand but I found this. Using an infra-red attatchment to my telescope I notice a small blue patch near
	pluto. Now, you may think, are you sure thats not just Pluto you are looking at? No, it is not, what I am looking at is a brand new planet, a planet 10, a bit smaller than
	our moon. I'll call this new plant, Excelsior.<br>
<br>
	Wait... You just said this was a "Planet" does that mean things live on Excelsior? Well, I figured it out. Excelsior always in the dark, it is very hard to see it, but I
	have a hypothesis. Now don't tell me that I'm fucking crazy, becuase I am not. You see this is just a theory, an hypothesis, I am unsure how true this is, we will have to
	wait until the Nibiru Cataclysm to find out, but I think it's Jaqi O Et. Yeah Jaqi O Et is on this planet and we are all going to die because of it, in the time frame of
	2015-2025.<br>
<br>
	But Literally wait right there. You called the planet "Excelsior" but then why is it called the "Nibiru Cataclysm" and not the "Excelsior Cataclysm". Well allow me to
	explain. Nibiru, is the psuedo-name for the planet, what people just thought it was. But because of how exiting this planet is, and what I can mean for the universe. I
	like to think of it not as Nibiru but as Excelsior. Nibiru is the actual event of it happening. Nibiru is the actual collision of the two planets. When Earth and Excelsior
	collide, that will be the Nibiru event. When Excelsior and Earth collide, it will cause an explosion and shock wave that will ripple through out the entire universe and 
	collapse this solar system and we and everything will die.<br>
<br>
	This is how the Sun Ducks want us to go. The Sun Ducks have found out that the humans know about their existance. The government is trying to find all the people who know 
	about the sun duck existance in hopes to prevent the Nibiru Cataclysm. But with these articles I have show and told the world about this and there is nothing they can do
	now, now that every one knows. Everyone has read, everyone has seen, everyone will now be the cause of the destruction of everything. The time has come. The Nibiru Cataclysm.
