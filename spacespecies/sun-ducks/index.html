	<p style="text-align: justify">Hello all.<br><br>
	This is article will be released on the same day as Pluto Bees and Nibiru. However, this article has been written several days after Pluto. I have not moved since I
	wrote Pluto, I am still in this bunker. I am now completely out of my emergency funds, I am now only a days worth of food left, and I am slowely rationing my bottle and a
	half of water I have left. And to make matters worse, I am confident they know where I am. I've led them in circles for the most part but I think they are close, so I
	think my time is up, I've give my self 4 days, tops. But I am here for one thing, and one thing only, to tell you the truth, and the truth will be told. So here is,
	Sun Ducks.<br>
<br>
	Now, the sun. We all know the sun, lovely little plasma ball in the sky, keeps us warm and has an 8 minute delay. The sun is also most commonly know for giving people red
	skin and causing cancer. Every thing that ever was is greatful for the sun. It is the reason which sustains life today on all of the planets. Why humans exist, and why
	everything exits. But, I have uncovered something unprecedented, the sun, as well all know and love, is actually controlled by ducks. Now here me out, you may have a
	million questions running through your head right now, and I'm going to answer them, in order.<br>
<br>
	1. Do ducks live on the sun? Yes<br>
	2. How big is the sun? 864,337.3 mi<br>
	3. Ducks? Yes<br>
	<br>
<br>
	I hope I answered all of your questions. Now for those of you are still confused, somehow, allow me to elaborate. The Ducks control this solar system. They have this glass
	control room in core that manages all of the planets. Yes hear me out. The ducks are in controll of everything, they made everything, everything that I have said about 
	adaptation of the species on the planets, completely wrong, I thought my evidence was clear, I thought I have analized everything, on each planet. I was thorough with my
	work and I wouldn't be here without it but I was wrong, on so many levels. Have you seen the movie Howard the Duck? I think it was a message, that we know of their
	existance. Thats why Marvel had a big gap in movies, from Howard the Duck to Iron Man, because we knew of the Ducks, but the government shut it down. Its all true. The
	governent is keeping this secret, thats what they are hidding, the ducks, the rulers of this solar system. This is what the government doesn't want to know, this is why
	they are after me, because they want to silence me from spreeding the truth, but I will get this article out even if I die today. Yes the ducks. The use Earth, as a hub
	for all of their creations, well I shouldn't say that.<br>
<br>
	Humans were their finest creation, advanced, intelligent, and capable. They made Earth, resource rich and plentiful, and put all of their creations and more onto Earth to
	see how their most advance creation could handle everything being thrown that them. We prevailed. We exceeded expectations. And we are now self aware and they don't want
	us to know. The ducks are using the government to hunt down the people who know. The people you have no longer turned a blind eye. But I won't give up, I am determined.
	The ducks, are growing restless, they will come, and don't doubt their pressence. The "ducks" that currently exists on Earth, are frauds. The ones from the sun, will be a
	bright orange, they are the real enimes. How do I know that its the orange ducks? One has been following me, I've seen it. Ever since I started running theres been one 
	following me. I can even see it right now, in this bunker, but It does not notice that I have noticed it.<br>
<br>
	But the government is getting close, and I am about to go. The Ducks are key to everything. The Ducks are everthing, I have been misinformed but I am here to inform you.
	Also, you may be wondering how the website is still up, and how the government has not taken it down. Well I'll let you figure that out, don't want to share my secrets
	with any unwanted people.
<br>
<br>

	This is the last article in the Space Species saga. I will have Pluto and Nibiru as well, but this is the end. Truely the end. We have reached the wall. So I
		really want to take this time here and now to give a big thanks for reading these articles, you guys mean a lot, and you are the reason I have kept doing them. I
		have been out running the government, my attempts to seek asylum in other countries have came up fruitless and I have accepted my fate with imprissonment. I can 
		no longer escape Obama, NASA, the black people, and now more recently, the Mayo Clinc. All of these organizations all after me, and I am left now defenseless, there
		is nowhere I can run, nowhere I can hide. I am gone. This is my last words. I hope you all remember me. <br>
<br>
                                                                                                                       ~Nolan Kingsly
