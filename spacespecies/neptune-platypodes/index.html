	<p style="text-align: justify">Hello all.<br><br>
	Today, I must inquire you to allow a small quicky update on how things are moving along. We are very closely reaching the end of the articles, I not joking, only one left!
	I am actually crying and shaking, Pluto. Again as I said in my previous, I might be going back to my earlier articles and fixing them, and fleshing them out, because I am
	dissapointed at their state. I am going to be sad when these articles are coming to a close, because I'll be going back to custody, I can't fight the gov for too much
	longer, I've had to change locations at least 6 different times, and one of the times was because it was the other man who tried to get me. I've been having weird dreams.
	But I am certain the SS is real. Lets continue with the article.<br>
<br>
	Okay, allow to start off, literally what the fuck are platypodes. I'm serious, literally what the fuck are they. Well firstly its like god didn't fucking care about them, 
	they are so damn werid I swear to god. Its looks like a mix between a beaver and a duck. God literally ran out of ideas and fucking stapled the beak and the feet of a duck
	and put them on a beaver and called it a platypus. Platypus literally translates to flat-footed. The platypus is the most useless fucking living creature ever exists and
	literally nobody cares about them. But for some god for fuck reason, they live on Neptune. Look I am not making this shit up, I have provided evidence.
	
	Some Confusion. So for you degenerates who don't understand why it is "Playtpodes" and not "Platypi" or "Platypuses" it is because of its Greek nature. You see for example
	the plural word for "cactus" is "cacti" that is because the word "cactus" is actually a latin derivative which gets the latin suffix "-i" for the ending of cactus. For 
	"Octopus" and "Platypus" are both greek derivatives that are legally not allowed to use the latin suffix "-i" and use the greek suffix "-podes", you actually can't
	Latinfy a Greek word, thats literally and legally not allowed, it any way shape or form. You are wrong. Sorry to edubate, but I needed to.<br>
<br>
	Now we all know Neptune, right? Big gaint thing that we like to look at but really serves a small purpose to us? Yeah, all mighty god of the seas. Who can literally 
	control the seas. Like, who does that? I'm confused, the Seas are literally the most useless thing ever on Earth. They literally serve no purpose that to house food.
	Honestly, if you want real food, kill a cow. Honest to god, who ever santist hell bitch monster decided to make a borger with lab grown meat is the worst person ever to
	exist. Here, I leave a very important poll, that I would for you all to answer, it'll be very interesting to read these results hmmmmm yesm.<br>
<br>
	Ok so back to Neptune, the planet. I literally posted the Uranus article, and realized all of the Uranus images were Neptune, and I literally screamed. They look identical, there is no difference. Well nenptom has a Hydrogenic atmosphere, meaning that it can only support water life, as we all know. But Neptune literally choose the
	bitchiest fucking Species to evolve. Literally nobody cares about Platypodes. I can't find a single person who does. Well anyway, The Platypodes evolved like every other
	species in the past. They only breath raw hydrogen, and because there is a very limited mantle and a very strong atmosphere. And they look pretty much identical to the 
	ones on earth because they can still fly using their deformed duck hands. <br>
<br>
	I mean too be fair. At least they are smart enought to host a Nazi and Communist regime at the same time, led by the same Platypus, incredible. Once they realize what rock they are on, they will literally crash neptune into pluto, nothing personal.<br>
<br>
	I actually hate Platypodes, I don't know if you have recieved the underlying message in this article. I actually dislike Platypodes, because they are literally the most
	nothing creature to ever exist in man kind. And the entire planet of Neptune is running rampant with these creatures (the neptune varient). So honestly feel I feel the 
	worst for Neptune, because they get the shitty animal. And the Neptune varient is literally just greener with an oranger beak. They Don't serve any purpose, and honestly
	I feel bad for Neptune and the Platypodes existance in the Universe.<br>
<br>
	Thank you everyone, the last article, Pluto coming soon!
