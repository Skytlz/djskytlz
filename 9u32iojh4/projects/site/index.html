	<p>This made by *Skytlz*, is meant to share my personal on going projects that I'm working on. This site is one of my first project I first tackled.
	This site was created first in 2012 to promote an earlier project that is dicontinued for the time being. I took over the site entirely to make it more modern and more updated. This entire site is made in Adobe Dreamweaver, and I'm working on it virtually everyday to make it better.
