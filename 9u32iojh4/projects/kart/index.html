<h1>Go Kart Go! 2</h1>
<div class="paragraph"><p>
	Back in 2014 I made a small game, called Go Kart Go. It didn't get very popular, though it did gain some attention. The page for the game gained 6k views 
	and it was download 1.6k times. It recieve 4 of 5 stars. However, the game as terrible, very glitchy and buggy, barely functional and overall not fun
	to play. The game was only for the Mac and hit a dead end until I stopped updating the game in 2015. I took a break from game making and went to work
	on this website and the Phonebook series. But, now that the website is finished. I have started production of a sequel of my 2014 racing game. Go Kart Go 2.
