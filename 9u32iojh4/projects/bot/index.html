<h1>Epic Bot</h1>
<div>
<p>Epic Bot isn't a big huge AI meme or something like that, Epic Bot is a small Discord bot that you can add for your server. This Bot is not currently
on GitHub because in how its written. The bot is current being written in a simplified C# which is not ideal. I plan to re-write this Bot completely in
C++ however, you can still add this Bot to your discord server right now, just click the image below.</p>
